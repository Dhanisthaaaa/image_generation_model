DCGAN - Face Generation with PyTorch

This project uses a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) implemented in PyTorch to generate realistic human face images, trained on the CelebA dataset.

⚠️ Note: This model is intended for experimental and educational purposes only. For production or real-time applications, extensive training, fine-tuning, and performance optimization are required.

# 🧠 Models

Generator: Takes in a 100-dimensional random noise vector and generates 64x64 RGB face images.
Discriminator: A CNN that classifies real vs fake images and helps the generator improve.
# 🔧 Requirements

Install required packages (use %pip install if running in a notebook):

pip install torch torchvision matplotlib gdown
# 📦 Dataset

This project uses the CelebA dataset. To download and extract it:

Visit the official site or use gdown for direct downloads (if you have a link).

Place all aligned face images inside img-align-celeba/ directory.

img-align-celeba/  
└──celebA/  
    ├── 000001.jpg  
    ├── 000002.jpg  
    └── ...  


#  🚀 Training

Open the Jupyter Notebook celeba_gan.ipynb and run the cells step by step.

The generator and discriminator are trained using the Binary Cross-Entropy Loss.

The generator learns to create realistic faces from random noise.

The discriminator learns to distinguish real CelebA images from fake ones generated by the generator.

#  🖼️ Output

Face images are generated every few epochs and saved as celeba_epoch_X.png

Loss values for both networks are plotted and saved as celeba_loss.png

#  💡 Tips

Training GANs can be unstable. Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, or adding gradient penalty.

Try increasing resolution (128x128) or using a progressive GAN setup.
